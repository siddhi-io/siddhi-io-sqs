For each message deduplciation id will be selected from the attriibute 'deduplicationID' in the outStream.","title":"sqs (Sink)"},{"location":"api/latest/#source","text":"","title":"Source"},{"location":"api/latest/#sqs-source","text":"SQS source allows users to connect and consume messages from a AWS SQS Queue.

SQS source will establish the connection to a queue using given configurations and start consuming xml messages from the queue. Once a message is received by the source from the given queue, 'xml' mapper will generate a siddhi event from that message and pass it to the inStream.","title":"sqs (Source)"}]}
